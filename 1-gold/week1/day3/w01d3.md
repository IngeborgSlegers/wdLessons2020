## Recap













## Loops

Create a new folder and file:

```
javascriptMay2020 (or whatever)
  └┬ javascriptLibrary
   └┬ 1-jsFundamentals
    └┬ 3-loops            # new folder
     └─ 01-forLoops.js    # new file
```

JavaScript has a few different kinds of loops:
- `for`
- `for ... in`
- `for ... of`
- `do ... while`
- `while`

### `for` loops

Let's start with the regular `for` loop.
- A `for












### `for ... in` loops

`for ... in` loops are used to go through the keys in an object.



```js
let student = { name:"Peter", awesome: true, degree: "JavaScript", week: 1 };

for (let item in student) {
  console.log(item);  // name awesome degree week
}
```

What is going on?
- We use the same `for` keyword, but now the parentheses contain something different.
- In the parentheses, we declare a variable (here `item`) and use the `in` keyword followed by the object we want to go through
- The following block of code (surrounded by `{...}`) is executed once for each value of `item`, that is, for each key in the object
- To be explicit, we execute the `console.log` with `item` having the value of `name`, then we execute it *again* with `item` having the value of `awesome`, and so on.



To go through the *values* of an object, we need to use *square-bracket notation* (more on this later).

```js
for (let item in student) {
  console.log(student[item]);  // Peter true JavaScript 1
}
```



Can we use `for ... in` loops for arrays?
Yes, but not quite how you'd expect:

```js
let catArray = ['tabby', 'british shorthair', 'burmese', 'maine coon', 'rag doll'];

for (let cat in catArray) {
  console.log(cat);
}
```

This prints out the numbers 0 through 4 in order. Why?
- Remember, arrays are very special kinds of objects.
- A `for ... in` loop goes through the *keys* of an object.
- What are the keys of an array? Its *indices*.
- To go through the *values* of an array, we need a different loop...

### `for ... of` loops

- These are used to *iterate* through the values in any *iterable*.
- An iterable is anything we can go through the values one by one.
- The most basic example of an iterable is an array.

```js
for (let cat of catArray) {
  console.log(cat, "says meow");
}
```
