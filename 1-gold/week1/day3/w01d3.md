## Loops

Create a new folder and file:

```
javascriptMay2020 (or whatever)
  └┬ javascriptLibrary
   └┬ 1-jsFundamentals
    └┬ 3-loops            # new folder
     └─ 01-forLoops.js    # new file
```

JavaScript has a few different kinds of loops:
- `for`
- `for ... in`
- `for ... of`
- `do ... while`
- `while`

### `for` loops

Let's start with the regular `for` loop.
- A `for












### `for ... in` loops

Create a new file:

```
3-loops
  └─ 03-forInLoops.js
```


`for ... in` loops are used to go through the keys in an object.



```js
let student = { name:"Peter", awesome: true, degree: "JavaScript", week: 1 };

for (let item in student) {
  console.log(item);  // name awesome degree week
}
```

What is going on?
- We use the same `for` keyword, but now the parentheses contain something different.
- In the parentheses, we declare a variable (here `item`) and use the `in` keyword followed by the object we want to go through
- The following block of code (surrounded by `{...}`) is executed once for each value of `item`, that is, for each key in the object
- To be explicit, we execute the `console.log` with `item` having the value of `name`, then we execute it *again* with `item` having the value of `awesome`, and so on.



To go through the *values* of an object, we need to use *square-bracket notation* (more on this later).

```js
for (let item in student) {
  console.log(student[item]);  // Peter true JavaScript 1
}
```



Can we use `for ... in` loops for arrays?
Yes, but not quite how you'd expect:

```js
let catArray = ['tabby', 'british shorthair', 'burmese', 'maine coon', 'rag doll'];

for (let cat in catArray) {
  console.log(cat);
}
```

This prints out the numbers 0 through 4 in order. Why?
- Remember, arrays are very special kinds of objects.
- A `for ... in` loop goes through the *keys* of an object.
- What are the keys of an array? Its *indices*.
- To go through the *values* of an array, we need a different loop...

### `for ... of` loops

Create a new file:

```
3-loops
  └─ 03-forOfLoops.js
```


- These are used to *iterate* through the values in any *iterable*.
- An iterable is anything we can go through the values of one by one.
- The most basic example of an iterable is an array.

```js
let catArray = ['tabby', 'british shorthair', 'burmese', 'maine coon', 'rag doll'];

for (let cat of catArray) {
  console.log(cat, "says meow");
}
```

Strings are also iterable, characterwise:

```js
for (let letter of "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") {
  console.log(letter);
}
```

**Question:** Why is each character on a separate line?  
**Answer:** We are making 34 separate calls to `console.log`, and each one starts a new line (*technically*, each one *ends* with a newline).

## Functions

### What is a function?

Let's start off with the motivation.
- As programmers, we want to *factor out* complicated pieces of logic into their own units
- Also, we want to create *reusable* code, that can be run more than once
- But we also want to be able to run the same code with different inputs

A function is like a small program within a program that can be given its own input, runs, and gives us an output.

If thinking about functions from math helps you, go for it; if not, don't worry about it.

We're going to start off by showing you how to write functions in JavaScript, then we'll see how to use them.


### Declarations and expressions

Create a new folder and file:

```
javascriptMay2020 (or whatever)
  └┬ javascriptLibrary
   └┬ 1-jsFundamentals
    └┬ 4-functions          # new folder
     └─ 01-declarationsAndExpressions.js     # new file
```

To *declare* a function:
- We start with the `function` keyword
- Then comes the name of the function
- Then a list of *parameters*/*arguments*, which can be empty, enclosed in parentheses
- Then a block of code enclosed with curly boys

Putting it all together, a simple function looks like this.

```js
function hi () {
  console.log('Hello there!');
}
```

Another way to write a function is to set it equal to a variable.
This is called a function *expression*.
Let's write a new function to do the same thing in this style.

```js
const hi2 = function () {
  console.log('Hello there again!');
}
```

A few notes on this:
- Notice the lack of a name after the `function` keyword.
- Instead, we are storing the function in the `hi2` variable.
- When writing function expressions, you usually will want to use `const` as opposed to `var` or `let`.
  - Why? Because variables that store functions will almost never change once declared
- What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?
  - Practically, it is that declared functions are hoisted, function expressions are not.


### Calling functions

Create a new file:

```
4-functions
  └─ 02-callingFunctions.js
```

Now that we have written a function, we want to use it. This is *calling* (or *invoking*) the function.

Take the following function.
```js
function hello () {
  console.log('Hello!');
}
```

- We see this is a function named `hello`, that takes no arguments (empty parentheses), and executes one line of code, the `console.log`
- To call this function, we write its name immediately followed by parentheses: `hello()`
- The parentheses are important because otherwise we are just writing the name of the function, not telling it to execute (run its code)

```js
hello;    // [Function: hello]
hello();  // Hello!
```

What's going on?
- When we just type `hello`, the name of the function, JavaScript essentially tells us "yep, that's a function".
- But with the parentheses, we call the function, and its code is executed.
- If you run this in node, you might also see `undefined` printed after "Hello!"
  - This has to do with *returning*, which we will get to in a minute...
