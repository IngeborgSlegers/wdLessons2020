## HTML

Start with an emmet completion, and change the title:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>HTML Walk Through</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
  </html>
  ```

Explain meta data of HTML.

### Walkthrough 1: Two Truths and a Lie
      
Gold:
- Make an `h1` tag saying 'Two Truths and a Lie'
- Make 3 `h3` tags, each saying a short blurb about that option (example: 'Been to Russia')
- Make 3 `p` tags (one for each `h3` tag), giving a short sentence elaborating that truth/lie
- Wrap it all in a div tag

Blue, using CSS: 
- Make the `h1` tag *light green* and *centered*
- Make each `h3` tag *blue*
- Make each `p` tag *red*
- Wrap it all in a *border* that is *thick* and *black*

Red, also in CSS:
- Curve the corners of that border
- Give it a background color of *gray*
- Wrap each truth/lie in separate `div`s, give them each a *border*, curve the border, and make each background color *light gray*
- Center everything in each `div`
- Line each truth/lie side-by-side 


```html
<style>

  h1 {
    color: lightgreen;
    text-align: center;
  }

  h3 {
    color: blue;
    font-weight: 1;
  }

  p {
    color: red;
  }

  #truthLie {
    border: 3px solid black;
    border-radius: 1em;
    background-color: grey;

    padding: 0.25em; 
    text-align: center;
  }

  .option {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-radius: 1em;
    background-color: lightgrey;
    text-align: center;
    width: 33%;
    display: inline-block;
  }

</style>
<div id="truthLie">
  <h1>Two Truths and a Lie</h1>
  <div class="option">
    <h3>Rubik's Cube</h3>
    <p>I can solve the Rubik's Cube</p>
  </div>
  <div class="option">
    <h3>Been to Iceland</h3>
    <p>I have been to Iceland</p>
  </div>
  <div class="option">
    <h3>Chickens</h3>
    <p>I own four chickens</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Walkthrough 2: Movie Rating
      
Gold: 
- Make an h2 tag saying 'Movies!'.
- Make a *table* with a *header*.
- In the header, have 4 columns with the headers reading: 'Movie Title', 'Year', 'Runtime', and 'Rating'.
- Add at least 3 movies (you can make the info up).

Blue, using CSS: 
- Add a background color of *light sky blue*
- Put a border around the table that is *black*

Red:
- Italicize the movie titles
- Set the table in the center


```html
    <style>
    
      table, th, td {
        border: 1px solid black;
        padding: 0.5em;
        background-color: lightskyblue;
      }

      th, td {
        padding: 0.5em;
      }

      table {
        margin: auto;
      }

      #movies {
        text-align: center;
      }

      .title {
        font-style: italic;
      }
    
    </style>

    <div id="movies">
      <h2>MOVIES!</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Movie Title</th>
          <th>Year</th>
          <th>Runtime</th>
          <th>Rating</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="title">A New Hope</td>
          <td>1976</td>
          <td>120 minutes</td>
          <td>PG</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="title">The Lion King</td>
          <td>1994</td>
          <td>88 minutes</td>
          <td>8.5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="title">Black Panther</td>
          <td>2018</td>
          <td>136 minutes</td>
          <td>PG-13</td>
        </tr>

        
      </table>      
    </div>
```


### Smiley face exercise

[exercise goes here]


### Assignment 1: CSS Creature 

Introduce [codepen.io](codepen.io).

Assignment is **due tomorrow**.






## JavaScript

Create a `1-grammarAndTypes` folder. [folder structure?]


### Comments

Create a new file in `1-grammarAndTypes` called `01-comments.js`.

```
1-grammarAndTypes
 └ 01-comments.js
```

What comments do for us:
1. Communicate with other developers by writing in plain English
2. Annotate certain sections of our code for our future selves

```js
//console output of 'hey';
console.log('hey');

//i mean, it is!  we're learning to code!  :)
console.log('Day 1 is great!');

console.log('How to plant trees below (multi-line)');
/*
Get tree
Dig hole
Remove tree from planter
Place tree in hole
Fill hole with soil, fertilizer, and mulch
Water
Enjoy tree
*/
```

### Variables

Create a new file:

```
1-grammarAndTypes
 └ 02-declarations.js
```

#### What is a variable?

```js
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

console.log(a + b);  // 3
```

Notes on variables:
1. A variable must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
2. Numbers may follow the above characters, but cannot come first
3. JavaScript is case sensitive: `hello` and `HeLlo` are different variables


#### Declarations

Declarations are the LEFT SIDE of a variable.
- This lets JavaScript know we are going to be using that variable.
- For `var x = 10`, it is simply `var x`.
- It is on the left side of the assignment operator `=`.

Initializations are the RIGHT SIDE of a variable.
- It sets the value of the variable.
- It incorporates the variable name (`x`), the assignment operator (`=`), and the value (`10`).
- Example: `x = 10` in `var x = 10`.

By using a declaration keyword *and* an initialization, we can do both at once.
- If we declare without initializing, the value of the variable is `undefined`.
- If we initialize without declaring, JavaScript will complain.

```js
var x;
console.log('Declaration:', x);  // Declaration: undefined

x = 10;
console.log('Initialization 1:', x);  // Initialization 1: 10

x = 33;
console.log('Initialization 2:', x);  // Initialization 2: 33

var y = 'Hello';
console.log('Both:',x, y);  // Both: 33 hello
```


#### Declaration keywords

There are three: `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- `var`: the "old" way to do it
- `let`: the "new" way to do it
- `const`: for variables that do not change

```js
let today = 'Great!';
const elevenFifty = 'Wonderful!';
console.log(today, elevenFifty);  // Great! Wonderful!

today = 'Lovely!'
console.log(today, elevenFifty);  // Lovely! Wonderful!

elevenFifty = 'Super'  // ERROR
```


### Types

Create a new file:

```
1-grammarAndTypes
 └ 05-types.js
```

Let's start off with `null` and `undefined`.
These are special values representing different kinds of nothing.


#### `null`

`null` represents an empty value.

It is like an empty container: nothing is in it, but it still exists as a space to fill.

```js
let emptyVar = null;

```



Editor's note: `typeof null` returns `object`, which is dumb. W3schools says:
> You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.


#### `undefined`

An undefined variable has no value assigned, and it is not even an empty container.

```js
let undef = undefined;
console.log(undef);  // undefined

let uninitialized;
console.log(unitinialized);  // undefined
```

So we see that explicitly setting a variable to be `undefined` is the same as not initializing it at all.
That is to say, when they are declared all variables are set to `undefined` if they are not given a value.

The UPS analogy:
- We've talked before about how every variable is basically a storage container in JavaScript.
- Think of variables with null and undefined as packages coming out of UPS.
- `null` packages are packages that were intentionally packed up with nothing, but have been assembled.
- `undefined` packages are packages that also have nothing in them, but have not yet been assembled to leave UPS.

You will see `undefined` a lot more than `null`, because JS uses `undefined` in a lot of places.

Now on to the interesting types!


#### Booleans

What is a boolean?

```js
let on = true;
console.log(on);  // true

let off = false;
console.log(off);  // false
```

Booleans can represent
- true/false,
- yes/no,
- on/off,
- or anything with a binary state.


#### Numbers

Many languages have different types for different types of numbers: integers, decimals, "floats", etc.
JavaScript only has one: `number`.

```js
let degrees = 90;
console.log(degrees);  // 90
```

If you are new to programming, some of the behaviors of numbers might be a little weird:

```js
var precise = 999999999999999;  // 15 9's
console.log(precise);           // 999999999999999

var rounded = 9999999999999999;  // (One more 9)
console.log(rounded);            // 10000000000000000

var notQuite = 0.2 + 0.1;
console.log(notQuite);  // 0.30000000000000004

var numbersAreHard = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10;
console.log(numbersAreHard);  // 0.3
```

This is because of how the numbers are represented internally in the computer.


#### Strings

A string is just a sequence of characters.
In JavaScript, we use single or double quotes to denote a string.

```js
let stringOne = "double quotes";
let stringTwo = 'single quotes';
console.log(stringOne, stringTwo);  // double quotes single quotes
```


#### Numbers vs. Strings

`10` and `"10"` are different things!

```js
let first = 1050 + 100; 
let second = '1050' + '100';

console.log(first);   // 1150
console.log(second);  // 1050100

console.log(typeof first);   // number
console.log(typeof second);  // string
```

What's going on here?
- When we have two numbers, `+` means *addition* as you normally understand it
- When we have two strings, `+` means *concatenation* (that is, smooshing the strings together)
- The technical term here is that the plus operator is *overloaded*

Interesting to note: if you have one string and one number, what happens?

```js
let third = 1050 + '100';

console.log(third);         // 1050100
console.log(typeof third);  // string
```

The string wins! (This is *type coercion*.)


#### Challenge: Set some variables

[Variables challenge](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/jsChallenges/blob/master/basics/addressVariables.md)



#### Objects

What is an object?
*A container that can hold multiple values.*
- Objects are denoted by curly boys `{}`
- An object has keys and values, so in `{color: "blue"}` the key is `color` and the value is the string `"blue"`
- Each key-value pair is separated by a comma

```js
let burritosNow = {
  size: 'large',
  quantity: 4,
  now: true
};

console.log(burritosNow);         // { size: 'large', quantity: 4, now: true }
console.log(typeof burritosNow);  // object
```

Objects are used *all the time* in JavaScript, for a wide variety of purposes.




#### Arrays

Arrays are just lists of things.
- Arrays are denoted by square brackets `[]`
- The values in an array are separated by commas


```js
var burritos = ['large', 4, true];
console.log(burritos);  // ['large', 4, true]
```






#### `typeof` operator

We have seen the use of the `typeof` keyword to find out the types of different variables.

`typeof x` gives us the type of `x` as a string.

Important caveat: the type of an array is *technically* `object`.

```js
typeof [1, 2, 3];  // object
```

Arrays are a very specialized type of object.
This works because they are also containers for different types of values.
