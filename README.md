# js2020

*New curriculum repository for JS / web dev courses*


## Format

This repository is structured into folders by badge. For Gold, which is the majority of the content at the moment, the structure is by week and then by day.




## Style guide

*in progress*

Files are [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with blocks of code. To turn on syntax highlighting in clients that support it (GitHub, VS Code), write the language ('html' or 'js' probably) immediately after the opening three backticks that enclose a code block:

```js
let x = undefined;
```

is written as

````
```js
let x = undefined;
```
````


When writing/transcribing/adapting a lesson, a good format is to have a header sentence followed by bullet points.
- This is easier to read than several sentences in a row
- A single salient point can be on its own line
- Third thing goes here
